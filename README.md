This mini-project collects hourly energy prices using the smartENERGY EPEX Spot AT API and saves them to a MongoDB database. It also includes a web dashboard to display the collected data. Additionally, the project calculates the optimal times to charge devices, such as batteries or electric cars, based on the hourly prices available for the next 24 hours.
